## Bash code and explanation

This repositories contains bash code and its explanations.

Take a look at the following image:-
- Firstly we create a shell script using the **touch** command and then *file-name*.sh
- We check the permissions assigned to certain files using **ls -al** command
- If we see that only read/write permissions are given, we add the permission to execute it using **chmod +x *file-name*.sh
- At the beginning of the shell script, remember to add the address you get after running the command **which bash** in the terminal after the hash-bang (#!) in your shell
